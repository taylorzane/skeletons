# Vue.js & Gulp & Webpack

This is a simple environment to quickly write a Vue.js app without having to worry about configuring gulp, webpack, etc.

# Installation
- `npm install` will install all necessary dependencies

# Building
- `gulp build` will compile all necessary files (once).
- `gulp watch` will compile all necessary files every time a change is made.

# Server
- `gulp serve` will serve the files in `./dist` on localhost. (Usually port 3000, unless there are conflicts.)
